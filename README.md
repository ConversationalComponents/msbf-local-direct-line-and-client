## bare-bones Direct Line implemetation for use with local MSBF

Serves a client application and provides direct line for an MSBF bot running on http://127.0.0.1:3978

## installation

`npm install`,  
`npm start`

If you make changes to the server you'll also need to run `npm run build` or `npm run build-windows` before running `npm start`

That's it, you're ready to go!

Please take a look at the [client's README.md](https://github.com/ConversationalComponents/msbf-local-direct-line-and-client/blob/master/client/README.md) for instructions on customizing the client
